# `ovos-stt-http-server` Documentation Hub

`ovos-stt-http-server` exposes any OVOS STT plugin as a network service. On
its own it speaks one native protocol — but with compat routers enabled it
also pretends to be every major cloud STT API and every popular
self-hosted server, so **unmodified consumer apps transparently land on
this box** instead of a third-party cloud.

| Goal | Read |
| :--- | :--- |
| Run the server and use the native API | [index.md](index.md) |
| Make unmodified consumer apps stop calling cloud STT services | [voice-pihole.md](voice-pihole.md) |
| Drive this server with the official Python/Node SDK of a specific vendor | [api-compatibility.md](api-compatibility.md) |
| Replace an existing self-hosted STT server on the wire | [api-compatibility.md](api-compatibility.md) |
| Bridge Home Assistant Voice / Voice PE | [wyoming-integration.md](wyoming-integration.md) |
| Audio format negotiation | [audio-formats.md](audio-formats.md) |

## Compat coverage

Mounted by `create_app()` and live on `dev` (a runnable client script for each
is in [`../examples/`](../examples/); full reference in
[`api-compatibility.md`](api-compatibility.md)):

### Commercial cloud STT

| Vendor | Prefix |
| :--- | :--- |
| OpenAI Whisper | `/openai/v1/audio/{transcriptions,translations}` |
| Deepgram | `/deepgram/v1/listen` (HTTP + WS) |
| Google Cloud STT | `/google/v1/speech:recognize` |
| AssemblyAI | `/assemblyai/v2/{upload,transcript,realtime/ws}` |
| Speechmatics | `/speechmatics/...` (REST + WS) |
| Microsoft Azure Speech | `/azure-stt/cognitiveservices/v1` (REST + WS) |
| AWS Transcribe | `/aws/transcribe` (batch + streaming WS) |
| IBM Watson STT | `/watson/speech-to-text/v1/recognize` (REST + WS) |
| Wit.ai (Meta) | `/wit/speech` |
| Chromium Web Speech | `/speech-api/v2/recognize` |

### Self-hosted / open-source server protocols

| Server | Surface |
| :--- | :--- |
| whisper.cpp HTTP server | `/whisper-cpp/inference` (+ OpenAI alias `/whisper-cpp/v1/audio/transcriptions`) |
| vosk-server (WebRTC) | `/vosk-webrtc/offer` (needs the `aiortc` extra) |
| faster-whisper-server | re-uses `/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions` |
| Wyoming (HA) | external adapter — see [wyoming-integration.md](wyoming-integration.md) |

### OpenAI-compatible Whisper hosts

Apps targeting Groq, Cloudflare Workers AI, Fireworks AI, Together AI, or
OpenRouter already speak the OpenAI `/v1/audio/transcriptions` contract — point
them at this server's `/openai/v1` prefix.

### Planned / not mounted by default

Present in the package but not mounted by `create_app()` (need a separate
process or CLI flag), tracked for a future release: vosk-server WebSocket
(`/vosk`), vosk gRPC (`--vosk-grpc-port`), vosk MQTT (`--vosk-mqtt-broker`),
and kaldi-gstreamer-server (`/client/ws/speech`).

## Voice-pihole

[voice-pihole.md](voice-pihole.md) collects every DNS-rewrite + reverse-proxy
+ CA-trust recipe across all the above vendors.

## TODO / WIP

### Streaming partial transcripts

Every compat router with a streaming surface (Deepgram WS, AssemblyAI
realtime, Speechmatics RT, Azure WS, Watson WS, vosk WS, AWS streaming,
Chromium) runs as buffered batch — audio is collected for the lifetime
of the stream and a single final transcript is emitted on close. OVOS
STT plugins don't expose a partial / interim hypothesis interface.

Needed:
- A VAD-driven chunker upstream of the OVOS plugin call, OR
- New plugin-side streaming support (OPM contract change).

### Vendor coverage gaps

- **Web Speech API native binary protocol** — the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`
  framing modern Chrome/Edge use for the in-browser `SpeechRecognition`
  Web API. Distinct from the legacy `/speech-api/v2/recognize` REST.
- **Rev.ai** — REST + streaming WS.
- **Soniox** — gRPC streaming.
- **AssemblyAI streaming V3** — schema differs from the V2 realtime.
- **whisper.cpp `verbose_json` with segment timestamps** — needs VAD pipeline.
- **AWS Transcribe streaming over real HTTP/2 event-stream** — the WS surface
  ships a plain WS; SDK-level apps that bypass WS need a translator.
- **vosk gRPC `StatsService`** — second proto service not implemented.
